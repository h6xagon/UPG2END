JER-Yahtzee
===========

10-18-2013:
C# console app to demonstrate Yahtzee logic.

The Dice class currently contains all the Yahtzee logic within a variety of methods to calculate the various field values.

The Dice class can also create an array of dice and "roll the dice" (see the PlayYahtzee method in Program.cs to see an example of randomizing the roll of the dice).

While the Program.cs file facilitates the structure of the game play, the Dice class contains all that would be needed to roll the dice and calculate all fields of a Yahtzee scorecare for ONE roll at present, but the class could easily be used within a more graphic-based C# app to create a more robust Yahtzee game.
